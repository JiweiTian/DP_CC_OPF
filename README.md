# Differentially Private OPF

This repository contains supplementary materials for the paper __Differentially Private Optimal Power Flow for Distribution Grids__ by V. Dvorkin, F. Fioretto, P. Van Hentenryck, J. Kazempour, and P. Pinson.

The proof of Theorem 2 is contained in [Appendix.pdf](https://github.com/wdvorkin/differentially_private_OPF/blob/master/Appendix.pdf)

The optimization model was implemented by using Julia
